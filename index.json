It helps enable scalable sensor simulation for training and testing autonomy systems, as well as applications like AR, VR, and video editing. We first create 3D assets from real-world data and then use the proposed simulation pipeline to realistically composite 3D assets into existing camera imagery.\n3D asset reconstruction We propose a self-supervision model to automatically build vehicle asset bank from the wild without 3D groundtruth.\n Multi-sensor feature is extracted from camera and LiDAR. Per-vertex deformation is applied on a learnable mean-shape to predict shape. Silhouette is differentiably rendered from the predicted mesh and compared with the labels. LiDAR consisteny is also applied    Self-supervised mesh reconstruction  Using the reconstructed 3D mesh, we can perform novel view warping of the source image to new target poses.\nWe build a large and diverse asset bank for simulation with over 8 000 unique vehicles.\nSimulation Pipeline GeoSim leverages the asset library to insert actors and simulate new images.\n  Step 1: Scenario Generation We first automatically generate a plausible placement and trajectory that complies with the existing traffic. An asset with a similar viewpoint is selected for rendering.   Automatic scenario generation \n  Step 2: Occlussion-aware rendering We render the selected asset at a new target pose. We account for occlusion by using dense depth from a pre-trained depth completion network. Additionally, we render a soft-shadow corresponding to the selected 3D asset considering a cloudy HDRI as the environement map..   Occlussion-aware rendering \n  Step 3: Post composition: Finally, we perform post-image composition. We use a synthesis network to handle inconsistent illumination and inpaint the discrepancies at the boundary, so that the vehicle is composited into the image seamlessly.   Post-image composition \n  Qualitative Results Video results in 4K resolution (4096x2160)\n\nCitation @inproceedings{chen2021geosim, title={GeoSim: Realistic Video Simulation via Geometry-Aware Composition for Self-Driving}, author={Yun Chen, Frieda Rong, Shivam Duggal, Shenlong Wang, Xinchen Yan, Sivabalan Manivasagam, Shangjie Xue, Ersin Yumer, Raquel Urtasun}, year={2021}, booktitle={CVPR}, }  ","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"5f7982cda567ba3a966c271915f69c90","permalink":"https://tmux.top/publication/geosim/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geosim/","section":"publication","summary":"\\[CVPR 2021 Oral\\] A geometry-aware image composition process (GeoSim) that synthesizes novel urban driving scenes by augmenting existing images with dynamic objects extracted from other scenes and rendered at novel poses.","tags":null,"title":"GeoSim: Realistic Video Simulation via Geometry-Aware Composition for Self-Driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Liang","Bin Yang","Rui Hu","Yun Chen","Renjie Liao","Song Feng","Raquel Urtasun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599004800,"objectID":"22141d42bda5b3d90d8dde616c67df7b","permalink":"https://tmux.top/publication/lanegcn/","publishdate":"2020-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lanegcn/","section":"publication","summary":"\\[ECCV 2020 Oral\\] We propose a motion forecasting model that exploits a novel structured map representation as well as actor-map interactions. Instead of encoding vectorized maps as raster images, we construct a lane graph from raw map data to explicitly preserve the map structure. To capture the complex topology and long range dependencies of the lane graph, we propose LaneGCN which extends graph convolutions with multiple adjacency matrices and along-lane dilation. To capture the complex interactions between actors and maps, we exploit a fusion network consisting of four types of interactions, actor-to-lane, lane-to-lane, laneto-actor and actor-to-actor. Powered by LaneGCN and actor-map interactions, our model is able to predict accurate and realistic multi-modal trajectories.

The key component is a novel tracking module that generates object tracks online from detections and exploits trajectory level features for motion forecasting. Specifically, the object tracks get updated at each time step by solving both the data association problem and the trajectory estimation problem.
